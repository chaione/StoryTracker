# Story Tracker

This is an iOS 8 application, built in Swift, used for learning & practice of the new language.  It doesn't do anything, and might not for a while, but instead serves
as being a "real" looking project that exhibits behaviors commonly required of client applications.

The app itself is a client for [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com).

High level concepts it covers (or intends to cover):

- Networking
- JSON Parsing
- Secure Storage
- NSUserDefaults access
- Core Data
- Storyboards
- Autolayout

## Work in Progress

It should be stated that this is a work in progress, and likely things will be left in an inconsistent state.  In addition,
some concepts in the application might be for prototyping or spiking various techniques, and should not necessarily be treated
as a best practice.

## Pivotal Tracker API

The app requires use of the Pivotal Tracker API. Take a look at the [Pivotal Tracker API Documentation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5) for more information. You'll need an account
in order to fetch an API Token on login in order to use the application.
